/*
Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....
If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to change the original array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 2, 1, 4, 3, 5.
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9]
Explanation: Array elements after sorting it in the waveform are 4, 2, 8, 7, 10, 9.

Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: [1]
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^7

Solution - 

class Solution {
  public:
    // arr: input array
    // Function to sort the array into a wave-like array.
    void convertToWave(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i += 2){
            swap(arr[i], arr[i + 1]);
        }
    }
