🧠 Part 1: When to Think About Backtracking
To know whether a problem requires backtracking, look for these signs:


🔍 1. The Problem Asks for All (or Some) Valid Configurations
Example phrasing:

    “Find all permutations...”

    “Generate all combinations...”

    “How many ways to place...”

    “Solve the puzzle...”

    “Can you place elements under constraints?”
This hints that you’re searching through a decision tree of possibilities — which is where backtracking shines.


🔍 2. The Search Space Is Large but Constrained
Backtracking avoids brute-force by pruning invalid paths early.

For example:

    Generating all combinations of a string of length 10 has 2^10 = 1024 combinations.

But with constraints, only a small fraction are valid.
So backtracking allows you to build incrementally and discard failures early.


🔍 3. The Problem Has Implicit Choices to Make Step-by-Step
Backtracking is good when:

You build a solution step-by-step (e.g., character by character, number by number, position by position).
Each step involves choices from a pool (e.g., pick 1 of 3 next letters).


🔍 4. You Can Try Something, and "Undo" It
Backtracking is about trying something and then backing up if it doesn't work.

So if:

    You can make a move

    Check if it’s valid

    Then recurse

    And if needed, undo the move

→ it’s probably a backtracking problem.




💡 Part 2: The Mental Framework for Backtracking
Let’s simplify your thinking into a framework you can apply to any backtracking problem:

🔁 1. Define the “State” of the Problem
What do you need to keep track of? For example:

    For generating permutations: current permutation

    For solving a maze: current position

    For N-Queens: current board configuration

State = Partial solution so far


🧩 2. Define the “Choices”
What options can I try from the current state?

Examples:

    Pick any unused number

    Move to any neighbor cell

    Place a queen in any column

Choices = Next things to try


⚠️ 3. Define the “Constraints”
What makes a choice invalid?

    Number already used?

    Position unsafe?

    Exceeds required sum?

Constraints = Early pruning


✅ 4. Define the “Goal”
When is the solution complete?

    All characters used

    Reached destination

    Placed all N queens

Goal = Stop condition




🛠️ Backtracking Skeleton
void backtrack(State current) {
    if (goal_reached(current)) {
        process(current);
        return;
    }

    for (choice in choices_from(current)) {
        if (is_valid(choice, current)) {
            apply(choice, current);
            backtrack(current);
            undo(choice, current); // <-- Backtrack step
        }
    }
}


Recursion v/s Backtracking

| Aspect                  | Recursion              | Backtracking                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Style                   | Blind exploration      | Informed exploration              |
| Performance (avg case)  | Slower                 | Faster with pruning               |
| Code clarity            | Generic tree traversal | Structured, step-by-step choices  |
| Use for constraints     | Hard to manage         | Easy to express                   |
| Complexity (worst case) | Same as backtracking   | Same, but better avg. performance |
